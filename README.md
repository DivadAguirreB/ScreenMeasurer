This tool helps you to easily determine the screen size of your browser window. It can be of great use to those who are concerned with getting their responsive web layout right.

It's easy to integrate the tool. Just move the ScreenMeasurer.min.js file to a folder of your choice and refer to it using the standard <script src="" defer></script> tag.
